        <p>1. Confirmation bias is a tendency for people to favor information that confirms their preconceptions. As a
            result, people recall information from memory selectively, and interpret it in a biased way, in particular
            for emotionally significant issues and established beliefs. Biased search, interpretation and recall have
            been invoked to explain attitude polarization (disagreeing parties diverging further when they are exposed
            to the same evidence), belief perseverance (beliefs persisting after the evidence for them is shown to be
            false), the primacy effect (data encountered early in a series being given more weight) and illusory
            correlation (people falsely perceiving an association between two events or situations). Explanations for
            these biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information. Confirmation
            biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face
            of contrary evidence. This can lead to disastrous decisions, especially in organizational, military and
